Workflow
--------

scATAC-pro consists of two units, the data processing unit and the downstream analysis unit. The data processing unit takes raw fastq files as input and outputs peak-by-cell count matrix, QC report and genome track files. It consists of the following modules: demultiplexing, adaptor trimming, read mapping, peak calling, cell calling, genome track file generation and quality control assessment. The downstream analysis unit consists of the following modules: dimension reduction, cell clustering, differential accessibility analysis, gene ontology analysis, TF motif enrichment analysis, TF footprinting analysis, linking regulatory DNA sequences with gene promoters, and integration of multiple datasets. We provide flexible options for most of analysis modules.

Installation
------------

-   Note: It is not necessary to install scATAC-pro from scratch. You can use the docker or singularity version if your system support (see [Run scATAC-pro through docker or singularity](#run-scATAC-pro-through-docker-or-singularity) )
-   Run the following command in your terminal, scATAC-pro will be installed in YOUR\_INSTALL\_PATH/scATAC-pro\_1.5.2

<!-- -->

    $ git clone https://github.com/wbaopaul/scATAC-pro.git
    $ cd scATAC-pro
    $ make configure prefix=YOUR_INSTALL_PATH
    $ make install
     
Updates
------------
- Now provide [scATAC-pro tutorial in R](https://scatacpro-in-r.netlify.app/index.html) for access QC metrics and perform downstream analysis
- Current version: 1.5.2
- Highlighted updates
    * Be compatible with Seurat v5 (v1.5.2)
    * **integrate** module takes input as a [SampleSheet](SampleSheet.csv) file, in which sample names, paths of peaks, fragments and cell barcodes files for each sample can be specified. Other parameters for integration are specified in the [configure_user](configure_user.txt) file (v1.5.1)
    * New module **reprocess_cellranger_output** added, to reprocess 10x scATAC-seq data (including atac in 10x multiome assay) originally processed by cellranger, taking cellranger processed .bam and .fragments.tsv.gz files as input (v1.4.3)
    * More friendly to single-end sequencing data (v1.4.2)
    * New module *labelTransfer* added, to do label trasfer (for cell annotation) from cell annotation of scRNA-seq data. First construct a gene by cell activity matrix, then use *FindTransferAnchors* and *TransferData* function from Seurat R package to predicted cell type annotation from the cell annotaiton in scRNA-seq data (v1.4.0)
    * New module *rmDoublets* added,to remove potential doublets using [DoubletFinder](https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder) algorithm (v1.3.1)
    * *footprint* module: support comparison of any two sets of cell clusters (v1.3.0)
    * *integrate*: add VFACS (Variable Features Across ClusterS) option for the integration module,
      **which reselect highly variable features across cell clusters after an initial clustering, followed by 
        another round of dimension reduction and clustering**, specify *Integrate_By = VFACS* in configure file,
        rare peaks (accessible in less than 1% of cells) were also removed from the highly variable features list (v1.1.2).

One command for many
-----------

-   **Input**: 
    -   fastq files for pair-end1 reads(pe1_fastq.gz), pair-end2 reads(pe2_fastq_gz) and cell barcords (index_fastq.gz) 

    -   **for data generated by 10x, you can just speficy the path to each FASTQ files folder per sample**

-   **IMPORTANT**: The parameters and options should be specified in a configurartion file in plain text format. Copy and edit the *configure\_user.txt* file in this repository and then in your terminal run the following commands:

```
    $ scATAC-pro -s process 
                 -i pe1.fastq.gz,pe2.fastq.gz,index.fastq.gz(,other_index_fastq.gz) 
                 -c configure_user.txt 

    $ scATAC-pro -s downstream 
                 -i output/filtered_matrix/PEAK_CALLER/CELL_CALLER/matrix.mtx (or matrix.rds) 
                 -c configure_user.txt

    ## PEAK_CALLER and CELL_CALLER is specified in your configure_user.txt file

```

-   If fastq files are generated using 10x genomics platform, you can just specify the path to fastq folder for a sample:

```
    $ scATAC-pro -s process 
                 -i PATH_TO_10x_fastqs_directory 
                 -c configure_user.txt 
```

-   For data processing, if fastq files have been demultiplexed as the required format with the barcode recorded in the name of each read as @barcode:ORIGIN\_READ\_NAME , you can skip the demultiplexing step by running the following command:

```
    $ scATAC-pro -s process_no_dex 
                 -i pe1_fastq,pe2_fastq
                 -c configure_user.txt 
```

-   To reprocess data originally processed by cellranger:

```
    $ scATAC-pro -s reprocess_cellranger_output
                 -i cellranger_generated.bam_file,cellranger_generated_fragments.tsv.gz_file
                 -c configure_user.txt

```

- **NOTE**: 
  - Some large mapping index and genome annotation files can be downloaded [here](https://chopri.box.com/s/dlqybg6agug46obiu3mhevofnq4vit4t)
  - The **output** will be saved under ./output as default
  - --verbose (or -b) will print the running message on screen, otherwise the message will only be saved under output/logs/MODULE.txt
  - To access QC metrics and perform downstream analysis in R, see [scATAC-pro tutorial in R](https://scatacpro-in-r.netlify.app/index.html) 


Step by step guide to running scATAC-pro
---------------------------

-   **IMPORTANT**: you can run scATAC-pro sequentially. The input of a later analysis module is the output of the previous analysis modules. The following tutorial uses fastq files downloaded from [PBMC10k 10X Genomics](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/datasets/1.1.0/atac_v1_pbmc_10k?) 
    
-   <u>Run scATAC-pro sequentially (specify PEAK_CALLER = MACS2 and CELL_CALLER = FILTER or other values in the configure_user.txt file) </u>

- After clustering, user can interactively visualize and analyze the data with module *visualize* 

```
scATAC-pro -s visualize -i output/downstream_analysis/PEAK_CALLER/CELL_CALLER/VisCello_obj -c configure_user.txt

```
- Note that the visualization can also be done through R/Rstudio:

```
devtools::install_github("qinzhu/VisCello", ref="VisCello-atac") ## install the package 

library(VisCello.atac)

cello('output/downstream_analysis/PEAK_CALLER/CELL_CALLER/VisCello_obj') ## launch VisCello in your web browser with prepared data
```

- More details about the visualization module can be found at [VisCello](https://github.com/qinzhu/VisCello/tree/VisCello-atac)

Run scATAC-pro through docker or singularity
----------------------------------
In case you have problem in installing dependencies, you can run scATAC-pro without installing dependencies as following:

1. Pull the docker image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/wbaopaul/scatac-pro), and run it through singularity (which is more friendly with high performance cluster or HPC, and linux server) by running the following commands:

```
$ singularity pull -F docker://wbaopaul/scatac-pro:latest 
## will generate scatac-pro_latest.sif in current directory

$ singularity exec --bind YOUR_BIND_PATH -H YOUR_WORK_PATH --cleanenv scatac-pro_latest.sif scATAC-pro -s XXX -i XXX -c XXX

```

2. More commonly, use it on a HPC cluster, here is an example script for running mapping step in my case (please change the file paths to yours): 
  - write a script mapping.sh with something essially like this:

```
#!/bin/bash
module load singularity ## load singularity in your system

## pull the docker image
## generating scatac-pro_latest.sif in your current directory
singularity pull -F docker://wbaopaul/scatac-pro:latest  ## just need run this line once

singularity exec --bind /mnt/isilon/ --cleanenv -H /mnt/isilon/tan_lab/yuw1/run_scATAC-pro/PBMC10k scatac-pro_latest.sif \ 
scATAC-pro -s mapping -i fastq_PE1_file,fastq_PE2_file -c configure_user.txt

```
  - then sumbit your job on your HPC (e.g. qsub or sbatch mapping.sh)

  - **NOTE**: 
    - YOUR_WORK_PATH is your working directory, where the outputs will be saved 

    - All inputs including data paths specified in configure_user.txt should be accessible under YOUR_BIND_PATH

    - NOTE: if running the *footprint* module, remember to download the reference data [rgtdata](https://chopri.box.com/s/dlqybg6agug46obiu3mhevofnq4vit4t) folder into YOUR_WROK_PATH
